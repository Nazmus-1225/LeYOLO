You can find the LeNeck combination with various backbones directly hard-coded within the Ultralytics environment. However, if you have your own backbone and training loop and want to understand/use the versatile object detectors, you can find the detailed code in the nn.py file.
Using MobileNetv3 as an example, it explains how we join a backbone with LeYOLO.
